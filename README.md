    "It may seem like a simple act, but handwashing has always been a critical life-saving intervention to stop the spread of disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, Childbed Fever was a devastating disease. It affected women within the first three days after childbirth and progressed rapidly, causing acute symptoms of severe abdominal pain, fever and debility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis worked at the Vienna General Hospital's maternity clinic on a 3-year contract from 1846â€“1849. There, as elsewhere in European and North American hospitals, childbed fever, was rampant, sometimes climbing to 40 percent of admitted patients. He was disturbed by these mortality rates, and eventually developed a theory of infection, in which he theorized that decaying matter on the hands of doctors, who had recently conducted autopsies, was brought into contact with the genitals of birthgiving women during the medical examinations at the maternity clinic. He proposed a radical hand washing theory using chlorinated lime, now a known disinfectant.\n",

    "\n",
    "Starting from the summer of 1847 the proportion of deaths is drastically reduced as Semmelweis made handwashing obligatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evidently, handwashing reduced the proportion of deaths by between 6.7 and 10 percentage points, according to a 95% confidence interval. All in all, it would seem that Semmelweis had solid evidence that handwashing was a simple but highly effective procedure that could save many lives."
